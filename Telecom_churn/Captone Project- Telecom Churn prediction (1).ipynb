In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. \n","\n","For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the top business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.\n","\n","Recharging of the service: There are several variables that describe the duration, maximum, total amount and average of the recharge price of the service they avail, which include the 2G service, the 3G service, internet packages and call services\n","  - av_rech_amt_data: Average recharge data amount\n","  - count_rech_2g: Number of customers using 2G\n","  - count_rech_3g: Number of customers using 3G\n","  - max_rech_data: Maximum recharge for mobile internet\n","  - total_rech_data: Total recharge for mobile internet\n","  - max_rech_amt: Maximum recharge amount\n","  - total_rech_amt: Total recharge amount\n","  - total_rech_num: Total number of times customer recharged\n","\n","If there are missing values in the columns corresponding to these variables, this is because the customer did not recharge that month.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XuEsAS4qSaLi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Import relevant
